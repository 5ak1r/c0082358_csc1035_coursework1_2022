### WARNING

I got the TitleCase class from Google, it is not
my own code. I obtained it from the following link:
[Stack Overflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1086123/is-there-a-method-for-string-conversion-to-title-case).

I did this because Python has a built-in method for
title case ('.title()') and I wanted a fast way to 
do the same thing in Java. I believe this is allowed
according to the plagiarism rules, considering I am 
citing my source. If this is incorrect, however, I do
request that you mark this as though the class is not
included, as it is not a very complicated method, nor
does it do anything fascinating.
